## Why this project:
We wanna make a user friendly & advanced chatbot via an android application so that  one can access various info about SUST campus, departments, bus schedule, cafe, library, organizations, admission, class routine, exam, syllabus, medical center etc in the quickest & easiest way. Also a user can access the infos manually by visiting the application. That's the motivation we got so far.
 
## Used technologies:
 
### Flutter :
 Flutter is an open source framework by Google for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase. Here we used its functionalities required for developing the android application. Flutter sdk is installed first and configured for suitable environment.
### Dart :
Here we learned this programming language for basic implementation of flutter. A programming language used to code Flutter apps. Dart is another product by Google. 

### Firebase :
Firebase supports frameworks like Flutter on a best-effort basis. Here we use this backend service for user authentication (sing up & log in system). Before adding Firebase to this Flutter app, it needs to create a Firebase project to connect to the app.

### Dialogflow :
 We implemented this google service for the chatbot. Dialogflow is a natural language understanding platform that makes it easy to design and integrate a conversational user interface into your mobile app, web application, device, bot, interactive voice response system, and so on.
First an agent was created in dialogflow and learnt for various queries and replies.
 
### IDE/Editor:
We mainly used Visual Studio as IDE and installed required extentions such as flutter, dart etc. This is configured with the latest version for flutter plugins. VS code is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.
